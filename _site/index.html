    <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
      <h5> But... I already bought products that promised the same thing and I'm STILL looking for answers</h5>
      <p>Part of you might be so tempted, but the other part might be saying "how is this retreat different from other products? I don't want to waste my money on another product that doesn't get me the results it promises." Well, that's the entire reason we created The Social Media Retreat.<br>The difference between this retreat and any other is that we didn't luck into any of this. We had no job and no back up plan. We forced ourselves to learn how to make money from brand collaborations as nano-influencers. Instead of focusing on follower count, we focus on all the other aspects of content creation and how to show your value to brands. See, you can have 100K followers... but if you don't know how to successfully pitch yourself then you are going to struggle with income consistency.</p>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5> But... I'm scared it won't work for me</h5>
        <p>You're asking the wrong question! Instead of asking, "What if it won't work for me?" ask "What if it does work for me?!" Look, we know that investing in a retreat can be really scary. Wow, we were all so terrified when we first invested in ourselves. We've used our last dimes to pay for courses, but we dove into this new world of social media learning and the results speak for themselves.<br>
        Here's the thing: we believe in taking mentorship from people who are where you want to be, so that you can take shortcuts whenever possible to save yourself a lot of trials, errors, and frankly, headaches. Show up, do the work, and I will pave the way for you. <br>
        Making decisions from a place of fear isn't going to help you achieve those massive goals you've got, is it?

      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But... I've tried everything already</h5>
        <p>You might think you've tried everything already, but we aren't buying that - sorry! You might have seen what others were doing, tried and tested a few things a few times, thrown a ton of spaghetti at the wall and then given up when it didn't stick.
        <br>We've been there and know that there are a couple reasons things might not have worked out for you in the past. There could be an issue with your branding, or there could be an issue with your pitching strategy.
        <br>If there's an issue with your branding, it could mean you aren't attracting the right audience or speaking to the right people. If there's an issue with your pitching strategy it could be because you aren't reaching out to the right brands or doing all the necessary steps leading up to a pitch. (Yes, your pre-pitch strategy is just as important as the actual pitch!)</p>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
        <h5>But... I don't have an audience</h5>
        <p>Perfect! Even more reason for you to join us in Kenya! SO many people think that you need thousands and thousands of followers in order to make money as a content creator and that's simply NOT true! What you DO need is an engaged audience and a perfect pitching strategy. The collaboration bootcamp teaches you how to achieve both! </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But... I don't have time for this</h5>
        <p>This social media bootcamp gives you the knowledge on how to work for yourself, on your own time, so it just depends on how soon you want that to happen! I promise, your future self will be thanking your present self in no time when you have all the time in the world backpacking across SE Asia for a brand collaboration or counting your coin at home with the kids!

        <h5>To sum things up:</h5>
        <p>Over our careers we've put all our effort into growing an engaged audience and learning how to create mutually beneficial relationships with brands. And guess what - it works!
We’re so confident in the information/strategies we teach that if you implement what you learn you will make your money back over and over again. This course doesn't cost you money, it's a return on investment. Meaning IT PAYS YOU!
