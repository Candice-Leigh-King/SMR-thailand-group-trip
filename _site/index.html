    <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
      <h5> But I usually plan things myself and do my own thing…</h5>
      <p>We speak to travelers that come to Thailand all the time and the common issue they face is that they miss out on a lot of the must-do activities, and end up having looong trips in buses that are always uncomfortable. They almost always get caught in the infamous tourist traps, and end up spending more money for less. In his trip, we’ve included ALL the must-see places: Over 10 Islands, hikes, temples, hot springs, emerald pools, old town markets and so much more.</p>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5> I've done a tour before and it was not what it said it would be…</h5>
        <p>Firstly, that really sucks! We see this often: tour agents booking you a trip to a country they have NEVER been to themselves. We have personally done this exact trip many times and will personally be there with you to experience it again! We love it so much and have the perfect balance between relaxing and adventure!
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But I can’t pay for the trip all at once…</h5>
        <p>We have put together a payment plan that is budget friendly and enables you to pay in segments without breaking the bank. The group trip allows us to split the expensive parts of travelling solo or in a pair, so you can have an unforgettable Thailand experience at a fraction of the cost of a usual Thailand trip.</p>

        <h5>But I already have plans to go to Thailand</h5>
        <p>This trip has everything and more than you could want from a trip to Thailand at a very reasonable price. Save time on your trip that is usually spent scouting for the best excursions and trips and enjoy the moments you have. We have sourced the best possible deals so that you can rest assured that your experience will be an unforgettable one.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>I’ve already been to Thailand…</h5>
        <p>There is a reason why we have visited Thailand over 15 times and have chosen it to be our base, it really is that good. Thailand is a melting pot of culture, food and tradition all jam packed into one big country filled with limestone mountains and crystal clear waters. You’ve got temples, mountains, islands, ricefields, markets, bustling urban cities. 15 times is not enough.

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
        <h5>I don't have time to travel…</h5>
        <p>You need to make the decision for yourself. The truth is, if you don’t have enough time to treat yourself now with a once in a lifetime trip to one of the world's most beautiful places, you will never be able to make enough time for anything. You do have enough time to go on holiday. In fact, you need to go on holiday, because rest is good for your soul. "Not enough time" is an excuse to stay in your comfort zone, when in actual fact, the best things you’ll ever experience are outside your comfort zone. </p>

       <h4 class="editable">Why should I come on this trip to Thailand? </h4>
      <div class="panel1"><p class="editable">There is a reason Thailand is one of the most visited countries in the world. It is absolutly breathtaking and mind blowing. From the people to the nature, culture to food-Thailand is a bucketlist country, and we've put together a trip jam packed with all the MUST-DO'S on a Thailand trip. All the hassle of planning and getting pulled into tourist traps taken off your shoulders. We have personally gone to each and every place (twice). Not only will we be going to the most perfect places, But going together as a group and actually living in Thailand has enabled us to arrange the best experiences.

        <h4 class="editable"> What is this Thailand trip all about?</h4>
      <div class="panel2">
        <p class="editable">This trip is custom designed to experience the best that Southern Thailand has to offer. We’ve planned everyday so that fun, chill and adventure are perfectly balanced. Also, with the nature of this trip, if you want more chill than fun, then put your feet up at your relaxing resort(s). Want to spend a day or two soaking in the sun next to the hotel pool? Sure! Or how about getting a Thai massage for that matter? Sounds like the perfect getaway!</p>

        <h4 class="editable"> How much does it cost?</h4>
      <div class="panel3">
        <p class="editable">Today, you can join the Ultimate Trip to Thailand for a one time payment of only $1970 or a payment plan can be arranged. This trip is at a fraction of the price compared to what you would spend if you organized the same trip yourself. For only $1970, you're getting all accommodation, breakfast, transport in Thailand, national park entry fees for 10 DAYS! EVERYTHING is included except lunch and dinner. (We purposely excluded lunches and dinners on this trip, because one of the beauties of Thailand is that you can spend as low as $1.50 a meal or you can spend however much you want depending on your preferences.) But the real question you should ask isn't "How much is it?", the rather "Can I afford to put off my dreams for another year?"<br> In fact, this trip shouldn't have a price tag, because the treasured memories you'll make will be priceless. </p>

      <div class="panel5">
        <p class="editable">Honestly, Thailand is one of the safest places we know. We never feel unsafe and the islands are even safer. We actually leave our phones at restaurants all the time and have little ladies chasing us down the road to come fetch our phone. Lol. (Obviously, not recommened! Try remember your things.) </p>

        <h4> Am I guaranteed spot if I apply?</h4>
      <div class="panel7">
        <p class="editable">We want to make sure that everyone that attends this trip is genuine, rad and "safe to be around". So no, just applying does not guarantee you a spot. Once you apply, we will jump on a call with you and get to know you a little better. Spots are filled up on a first-come-first serve basis, so if you don’t get a spot chances are that you applied too late. We have already started receiving deposits. <b>Spots are filling up quickly!</b> </p>
