      <h5> But I usually plan things myself and do my own thing…</h5>
      <p>We speak to travelers that come to Thailand all the time and the common issue they face is that they miss out on a lot of the must-do activities, and end up having looong trips in buses that are always uncomfortable. They almost always get caught in the infamous tourist traps, and end up spending more money for less. In his trip, we’ve included ALL the must-see places: Over 10 Islands, hikes, temples, hot springs, emerald pools, old town markets and so much more.</p>

        <h5> I’ve done a tour before and it was not what it said it would be…</h5>
        <p>Firstly, that really sucks! We see this often: tour agents booking you a trip to a country they have NEVER been to themselves. We have personally done this exact trip many times and will personally be there with you to experience it again! We love it so much and have the perfect balance between relaxing and adventure!

      </div>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But I can’t pay for the trip all at once…</h5>
        <p>We have put together a payment plan that is budget friendly and enables you to pay in segments without breaking the bank. The group trip allows us to split the expensive parts of travelling solo or in a pair, so you can have an unforgettable Thailand experience at a fraction of the cost of a usual Thailand trip.</p>

        <p>This trip has everything and more than you could want from a trip to Thailand at a very reasonable price. Save time on your trip that is usually spent scouting for the best excursions and trips and enjoy the moments you have. We have sourced the best possible deals so that you can rest assured that your experience will be an unforgettable one.</p>

      <div class="col-4_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2  editable">
        <h5>But... I don't have time for this</h5>
        <p>This social media bootcamp gives you the knowledge on how to work for yourself, on your own time, so it just depends on how soon you want that to happen! I promise, your future self will be thanking your present self in no time when you have all the time in the world backpacking across SE Asia for a brand collaboration or counting your coin at home with the kids!
