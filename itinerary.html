    <p class="fadein">Thailand is known as the land of smiles and is one of the most welcoming places in the world. There is a reason that Thailand is in the top 10 most visited countries in the world. It's known for endless jaw-dropping tropical beaches, scattered islands, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples. Thailand really has it all, from an array of mouthwatering Southeast Asian cuisines, cultures and languages and is the ultimate travel experience.</p>
